This file contains problem set 1 solutions covering General Notes:
1)	A lot of Peter?s problem sets and exam questions are set up this way ? basic problem in 1, then add tweaks to the model in subsequent problems.  When possible, you don?t have to re-derive the answers in each question.
2)	Intuition is important.  When you compare results between models, don?t just compare the math.  Use words.
